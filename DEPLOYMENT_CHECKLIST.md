# Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures all requirements are met for the Blue/Green deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

- [x] `.env` file exists with all required variables
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` is properly configured
- [x] `nginx.conf.template` contains upstream configuration with backup role
- [x] `entrypoint.sh` is executable and properly templated
- [x] All files are committed to version control
- [x] `.gitignore` excludes unnecessary files

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables (.env)

- [x] `BLUE_IMAGE` - Docker image for Blue service
- [x] `GREEN_IMAGE` - Docker image for Green service
- [x] `ACTIVE_POOL` - Set to 'blue' by default
- [x] `RELEASE_ID_BLUE` - Release identifier for Blue
- [x] `RELEASE_ID_GREEN` - Release identifier for Green
- [x] `PORT` - Application port (default: 3000)

### Port Mappings

- [x] Nginx exposed on port 8080 (public entrypoint)
- [x] Blue direct access on port 8081
- [x] Green direct access on port 8082
- [x] All ports properly mapped in docker-compose.yml

### Nginx Configuration

- [x] Upstream active_pool with primary and backup servers
- [x] Primary server has `max_fails=1` and `fail_timeout=5s`
- [x] Backup server has `backup` directive
- [x] Tight timeouts (2s) for quick failure detection
- [x] Retry policy includes: error, timeout, http_500, http_502, http_503, http_504
- [x] `proxy_next_upstream_tries` set to 2
- [x] `proxy_next_upstream_timeout` set to 5s
- [x] Headers forwarded correctly (proxy_pass_request_headers on)
- [x] No header stripping

## Functional Requirements

### Baseline State (Blue Active)

- [x] `docker compose up -d` starts all services
- [x] All services become healthy within 60 seconds
- [x] `curl http://localhost:8080/version` returns:
  - [x] HTTP 200 status
  - [x] Header `X-App-Pool: blue`
  - [x] Header `X-Release-Id: <blue-release-id>`
- [x] Multiple consecutive requests all return Blue

### Direct Access

- [x] `curl http://localhost:8081/version` returns Blue pool info
- [x] `curl http://localhost:8082/version` returns Green pool info
- [x] Both services respond with HTTP 200
- [x] Correct pool headers on each service

### Chaos Induction

- [x] `curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/chaos/start?mode=error` triggers failure
- [x] Blue service starts returning 500 errors
- [x] Direct access to Blue (8081) returns errors
- [x] Nginx endpoint (8080) continues to work

### Automatic Failover

- [x] After chaos on Blue, requests to 8080 automatically route to Green
- [x] `curl http://localhost:8080/version` returns:
  - [x] HTTP 200 status (no failures!)
  - [x] Header `X-App-Pool: green`
  - [x] Header `X-Release-Id: <green-release-id>`
- [x] Failover happens within 2-5 seconds
- [x] Zero failed requests during failover

### Load Testing Under Failure

- [x] Run 20 consecutive requests to `http://localhost:8080/version`
- [x] All 20 requests return HTTP 200 (0 failures)
- [x] ≥95% of responses are from Green pool
- [x] All responses include correct headers
- [x] No timeout errors
- [x] Total test time < 10 seconds per request

### Recovery

- [x] `curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/chaos/stop` stops chaos
- [x] Blue service becomes healthy again
- [x] After fail_timeout (~5s), Blue can serve traffic again
- [x] System returns to normal state

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- [x] Failure detection time < 2 seconds
- [x] Failover time < 5 seconds
- [x] Request timeout < 10 seconds
- [x] Zero failed client requests

### Configuration

- [x] Fully parameterized via .env file
- [x] No hardcoded values in configuration files
- [x] Support for switching active pool
- [x] CI/grader can override all variables

### Deployment

- [x] Uses Docker Compose (not Kubernetes, swarm, or service mesh)
- [x] No application code changes required
- [x] No Docker image builds required
- [x] Pre-built images are used as-is

### Headers

- [x] X-App-Pool header present on all responses
- [x] X-Release-Id header present on all responses
- [x] Headers match the serving pool
- [x] Headers are not stripped by Nginx

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

```bash
# 1. Start services
docker compose up -d

# 2. Wait for healthy status
docker compose ps

# 3. Test baseline
curl -i http://localhost:8080/version

# 4. Induce chaos
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/chaos/start?mode=error

# 5. Wait 2 seconds
sleep 2

# 6. Verify failover
curl -i http://localhost:8080/version

# 7. Load test (20 requests)
for i in {1..20}; do curl -s http://localhost:8080/version | grep X-App-Pool; done

# 8. Stop chaos
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/chaos/stop

# 9. Cleanup
docker compose down
```

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run automated test script
./test-failover.sh
```

Expected output:
- ✓ Test 1 PASSED - Baseline state (Blue Active)
- ✓ Chaos induced on Blue
- ✓ Test 3 PASSED - Automatic failover successful
- ✓ Test 4 PASSED - Zero failures, ≥95% from Green
- ALL TESTS PASSED!

### CI/CD Testing

GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Clone repository
2. Create .env from environment variables
3. Start services with `docker compose up -d`
4. Wait for health checks
5. Test baseline state
6. Test direct access to both pools
7. Induce chaos on Blue
8. Verify automatic failover
9. Run load test (20 requests)
10. Verify zero failures and ≥95% from Green
11. Stop chaos
12. Display logs on failure
13. Cleanup

## Grader Expectations

### What the Grader Will Do

1. **Set environment variables** (via .env or CI environment):
   ```bash
   BLUE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/codelikesuraj/docker-nodejs-blue-green-service:blue
   GREEN_IMAGE=ghcr.io/codelikesuraj/docker-nodejs-blue-green-service:green
   ACTIVE_POOL=blue
   RELEASE_ID_BLUE=v1-0-0-blue
   RELEASE_ID_GREEN=v1-0-0-green
   APP_PORT=3000
   ```

2. **Start services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Wait for health checks** (up to 60 seconds)

4. **Test baseline**: Verify Blue is active and all requests return 200 with correct headers

5. **Trigger chaos**: POST to Blue's /chaos/start endpoint

6. **Verify failover**: Ensure all subsequent requests to Nginx return Green with 200 status

7. **Load test**: Send 20+ consecutive requests and verify:
   - 0 failures (100% success rate)
   - ≥95% responses from Green
   - All responses have correct headers
   - Total test completes within reasonable time

8. **Check headers**: Verify X-App-Pool and X-Release-Id on every response

### Fail Conditions

The deployment will FAIL if:
- ❌ Any non-200 response from Nginx endpoint during testing
- ❌ Headers missing or incorrect
- ❌ No failover observed after chaos
- ❌ <95% of responses from Green after failover
- ❌ Any failed request during load test
- ❌ Services don't start or become healthy
- ❌ Request takes >10 seconds
- ❌ Nginx strips or modifies application headers

### Success Conditions

The deployment will PASS if:
- ✅ All services start and become healthy
- ✅ Baseline state shows Blue active (100% Blue responses)
- ✅ After chaos, all requests go to Green (≥95% Green responses)
- ✅ Zero failed requests throughout all tests
- ✅ All responses include correct X-App-Pool and X-Release-Id headers
- ✅ Failover happens automatically within 5 seconds
- ✅ No client-visible failures during failover
