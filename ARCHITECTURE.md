## Failover Mechanism

### Normal State (Blue Active)

1. All client requests to `http://localhost:8080` route through Nginx
2. Nginx forwards requests to Blue service (primary upstream)
3. Blue responds with:
   - HTTP 200 OK
   - X-App-Pool: blue
   - X-Release-Id: blue-v1.0.0

### Failure Detection

When Blue fails (500 errors, timeouts, or connection errors):

1. **Immediate Detection** (within 2 seconds):
   - Nginx's tight timeouts (2s) trigger quickly
   - Connection errors, timeouts, or 5xx responses are detected

2. **Retry to Backup**:
   - Within the same client request, Nginx retries to Green (backup)
   - Client never sees the failure from Blue
   - `proxy_next_upstream` ensures seamless retry

3. **Mark Primary as Failed**:
   - After 1 failure (`max_fails=1`), Blue is marked as down
   - For the next 5 seconds (`fail_timeout=5s`), all traffic goes to Green

### Automatic Failover (Blue Failed, Green Active)

1. All subsequent requests route to Green (backup becomes primary)
2. Green responds with:
   - HTTP 200 OK
   - X-App-Pool: green
   - X-Release-Id: green-v1.0.0

3. **Zero Failed Requests**:
   - Clients receive HTTP 200 even during failover
   - Retry happens within the same request
   - No client-visible failures

### Recovery

1. After 5 seconds (`fail_timeout`), Nginx tries Blue again
2. If Blue is healthy, traffic gradually returns to Blue
3. Green remains as backup

## Configuration Flow

### Environment Variables (.env)

**Deployment Configuration:**
```
BLUE_IMAGE → Docker image for Blue service
GREEN_IMAGE → Docker image for Green service
ACTIVE_POOL → Which pool is primary (blue/green)
RELEASE_ID_BLUE → Release identifier for Blue
RELEASE_ID_GREEN → Release identifier for Green
APP_PORT → Application port (default: 3000)
```

**Monitoring Configuration:**
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL → Slack webhook for alerts
ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD → Error rate threshold percentage (default: 2)
WINDOW_SIZE → Sliding window for error rate (default: 200 requests)
ALERT_COOLDOWN_SEC → Cooldown between alerts (default: 300s)
MAINTENANCE_MODE → Suppress alerts during maintenance (default: false)
```

### Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml)

1. **app_blue service**:
   - Uses ${BLUE_IMAGE}
   - Exposes port 8081 (external) → 3000 (internal)
   - Sets environment: APP_POOL=blue, RELEASE_ID=${RELEASE_ID_BLUE}
   - Health checks every 5 seconds

2. **app_green service**:
   - Uses ${GREEN_IMAGE}
   - Exposes port 8082 (external) → 3000 (internal)
   - Sets environment: APP_POOL=green, RELEASE_ID=${RELEASE_ID_GREEN}
   - Health checks every 5 seconds

3. **nginx service**:
   - Uses nginx:alpine image
   - Exposes port 8080 → 80
   - Mounts nginx.conf.template and entrypoint.sh
   - Shared volume: nginx_logs (for alert watcher access)
   - Waits for both Blue and Green to be healthy before starting
   - Custom JSON logging to /var/log/nginx/access.log

4. **alert_watcher service**:
   - Uses python:3.11-slim image (no custom Dockerfile)
   - Installs dependencies: requests library
   - Runs watcher.py to monitor Nginx logs
   - Shared volume: nginx_logs (read-only)
   - Sends alerts to Slack webhook
   - Restart policy: unless-stopped

### Nginx Configuration Template (nginx.conf.template)

Uses envsubst to replace variables:
- `${ACTIVE_POOL}` → primary server (blue or green)
- `${BACKUP_POOL}` → backup server (automatically computed)
- `${PORT}` → application port

### Entrypoint Script (entrypoint.sh)

1. Computes BACKUP_POOL based on ACTIVE_POOL:
   - If ACTIVE_POOL=blue → BACKUP_POOL=green
   - If ACTIVE_POOL=green → BACKUP_POOL=blue

2. Runs envsubst on nginx.conf.template → /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

3. Tests Nginx configuration

4. Starts Nginx in foreground

## Request Flow

### Successful Request (Normal State)

```
Client → Nginx (port 8080)
         |
         ├-> proxy_pass to upstream "active_pool"
         |
         +-> app_blue:3000
             |
             +-> HTTP 200
                 X-App-Pool: blue
                 X-Release-Id: blue-v1.0.0
                 |
                 +-> Response to Client
```

### Failed Request with Automatic Retry

```
Client → Nginx (port 8080)
         |
         ├-> proxy_pass to upstream "active_pool"
         |
         ├-> app_blue:3000
         |   |
         |   +-> 500 Internal Server Error / Timeout
         |       |
         |       +-> proxy_next_upstream triggered
         |
         +-> Retry to app_green:3000 (backup)
             |
             +-> HTTP 200
                 X-App-Pool: green
                 X-Release-Id: green-v1.0.0
                 |
                 +-> Response to Client (client sees 200, not the 500!)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Zero Downtime
- Retry mechanism happens within the same client request
- Client never sees failures from the primary
- Seamless transition from Blue to Green

### 2. Quick Failure Detection
- 2-second timeouts for connect, send, and read
- Failures detected almost immediately
- Fast failover (typically < 2 seconds)

### 3. Header Preservation
- X-App-Pool header identifies which pool served the request
- X-Release-Id header identifies the release version
- All application headers are forwarded to clients

### 4. Health Monitoring
- Docker health checks every 5 seconds
- Nginx upstream health checking via max_fails/fail_timeout
- Both active and passive health monitoring

### 5. Parameterized Configuration
- All settings controlled via .env
- No hardcoded values
- Easy to switch between Blue and Green as primary

### 6. Testability
- Direct access to both pools (8081, 8082) for chaos testing
- Chaos endpoints for simulating failures
- Automated test scripts and CI/CD workflow

## Monitoring & Alerting Architecture

### Log Processing Flow

```
1. HTTP Request → Nginx
         ↓
2. Nginx processes request (with retry if needed)
         ↓
3. Nginx writes JSON log entry to /var/log/nginx/access.log
         ↓
4. Alert Watcher tails access.log in real-time
         ↓
5. Watcher parses JSON and extracts:
   - status (final HTTP status)
   - upstream_status (may contain multiple statuses like "502, 200")
   - pool (X-App-Pool header value)
   - timestamp, latency, etc.
         ↓
6. Watcher tracks state:
   - Request window (last 200 requests)
   - Current pool (last_pool)
   - Error counts and rates
   - System degraded flag
         ↓
7. Watcher detects events:
   - Failover (pool changed from blue → green)
   - High error rate (>2% errors in window)
   - Recovery (pool returned to blue OR error rate dropped)
         ↓
8. Alert with cooldown check → Slack webhook
```

### Alert Detection Logic

#### 1. Failover Detection
```
IF current_pool == initial_pool AND last_pool != initial_pool:
    → Recovery alert (back to primary)
ELSE IF current_pool != last_pool:
    → Failover alert (to backup pool)
```

#### 2. Error Rate Detection
```
window = last 200 requests
error_count = count of 5xx statuses in window
error_rate = (error_count / window_size) * 100

IF error_rate > threshold (2%):
    → High Error Rate alert
    SET system_degraded = True
ELSE IF system_degraded == True:
    → Recovery alert (from degraded state)
    SET system_degraded = False
```

#### 3. Upstream Status Parsing
```
Nginx may log: upstream_status = "502, 200"
This means: First attempt failed (502), retry succeeded (200)

Watcher logic:
IF any status in upstream_status >= 500:
    Track as error (even if final status is 200)
ELSE:
    Track final status
```

### Alert Cooldown Mechanism

Each alert type has independent cooldown tracking:

```
last_failover_alert = timestamp
last_recovery_alert = timestamp
last_error_rate_alert = timestamp

BEFORE sending alert:
    IF (current_time - last_alert_time) < cooldown_period:
        Log "cooldown active" and skip
    ELSE:
        Send alert and update last_alert_time
```

This prevents alert spam during oscillating failures.

### Slack Integration

**Alert Format:**
```json
{
  "attachments": [{
    "color": "warning" | "danger" | "good",
    "title": ":warning: - Failover Detected",
    "text": "Pool switch detected...\n\n- Previous Pool: blue\n- New Pool: green",
    "footer": "Time: 2025-10-30 15:20:15"
  }]
}
```

**Alert Types:**
1. **Startup Alert** (`:information_source:`) - Watcher started
2. **Failover Alert** (`:warning:`) - Traffic switched to backup
3. **Recovery Alert** (`:white_check_mark:`) - Traffic returned to primary or error rate dropped
4. **High Error Rate** (`:rotating_light:`) - Error threshold exceeded

### Maintenance Mode

When `MAINTENANCE_MODE=true`:
- All alerts are suppressed
- Events are still logged to console
- Useful during planned failover tests or deployments
- Auto-disabled when recovery is detected

## Performance Characteristics
